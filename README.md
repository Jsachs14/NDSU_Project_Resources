# NDSU_Project_Resources
This is a conglomeration of all the code used for my project with NDSU.

This project surrounded the creation of a nanotech-based diabetes sensor. The code in this repo is for various purposes, including:

-->Live Resistance Data Tracking
-->Onboard Code to run the sensor
-->Post-Sensor Data Processing

Have fun reading my gross work!
